Introduction
The Bible, composed of 66 books written over fifteen centuries by dozens of authors, presents a unified narrative: the story of humanity. It reveals who we are, our purpose, and our need for God. Through instruction, correction, and encouragement, it guides us toward truth—truth that is only fully realized in relationship with our Creator.

The Inadequacy of Man Without God
The Bible exposes humanity’s fundamental flaw: separation from God. Without a genuine personal relationship with an indwelling God, we are incomplete, unable to grasp our identity or fulfill our purpose. This inadequacy manifests in three key areas:" />

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Bible, composed of 66 books written over fifteen centuries by dozens of authors, presents a unified narrative: the story of humanity. It reveals who we are, our purpose, and our need for God. Through instruction, correction, and encouragement, it guides us toward truth—truth that is only fully realized in relationship with our Creator.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-inadequacy-of-man-without-god">The Inadequacy of Man Without God</h2>
<p>The Bible exposes humanity’s fundamental flaw: separation from God. Without a genuine personal relationship with an indwelling God, we are incomplete, unable to grasp our identity or fulfill our purpose. This inadequacy manifests in three key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Natural Relationships</strong> (Cosmology, Geology, Biology): Science explores the physical world, but without God, we miss its ultimate meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Human Relationships</strong> (Sociology, Psychology): Despite advances in understanding behaviour, conflict and brokenness persist apart from divine wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Relationships</strong> (Theology, Philosophy): We crave transcendence but remain empty without connection to our Creator.
The message is clear: Life without God is fragmented. We cannot truly understand the world, ourselves, or our purpose without Him.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="jesus-christ-the-perfect-manadequacy-restored">Jesus Christ: The Perfect Man—Adequacy Restored</h2>
<p>If the Bible reveals humanity’s inadequacy, it also proclaims the solution: Jesus Christ, the perfect model of humanity in relationship with God. The whole book is the glorious story of how God became flesh, the immortal became mortal, the Eternal One became a temporal being like us, for a while, in becoming man, always having a genuine personal relationship with an indwelling God and total dependence. In the story, which revolves around this theme, God has incorporated all the truths we need to know about ourselves, how to be a whole man as God created us to be.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Natural Relationships</strong>: Christ demonstrated dominion over creation (walking on water, calming storms)—not as a display of deity, but as a glimpse of humanity as God intended.</li>
<li><strong>In Human Relationships</strong>: Abraham’s peace with his enemies (Genesis 23:6) foreshadowed Christ’s power to reconcile.</li>
<li><strong>In Spiritual Relationships</strong>: Jesus embodied the &ldquo;righteousness, peace, and joy&rdquo; (Romans 14:17) we were designed to experience.
Christ is the blueprint for restored humanity—living in dependence on God, fulfilling our original calling.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-the-bible">The Purpose of the Bible</h2>
<p>Why did God give us this book? Ephesians 1:9–12 and 4:11–13 reveal His plan: to unite all things under Christ and mature us into His likeness. The Bible is not merely a moral guide but a transformational tool. As Paul writes, Scripture equips us for &ldquo;every good work&rdquo; (2 Timothy 3:16–17), empowering us to reflect Christ’s character.
Rudyard Kipling’s poem &ldquo;If&rdquo; captures the ideal of human maturity—perfected only in Christ.
IF
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don&rsquo;t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don&rsquo;t give way to hating,
And yet don&rsquo;t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
<p>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you&rsquo;ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build &rsquo;em up with worn-out tools:</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the will which says to them: &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds&rsquo; worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that&rsquo;s in it,
And &ndash; which is more &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be a Man, my son!</p>
<p>Who fulfills them? Who has done it? In the course of human history, no one &ndash; except One – Jesus Christ!  The Bible’s purpose is to make this ideal attainable through Him.</p>
<h2 id="the-gospel-the-heart-of-revelation">The Gospel: The Heart of Revelation</h2>
<p>Major Ian Thomas distilled the gospel’s essence:</p>
<h3 id="1-christ-had-to-be-who-he-was-to-do-what-he-did">1. Christ Had to Be Who He Was to Do What He Did</h3>
<p>Jesus was not merely a moral teacher or prophet; He was God incarnate—the Eternal Son stepping into time (John 1:14). Only a sinless, divine Savior could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bear the weight of human guilt (2 Corinthians 5:21).</li>
<li>Defeat death’s power (Hebrews 2:14–15).</li>
<li>Bridge the chasm between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5).
<strong>The gospel begins with this staggering truth: The Creator became the Redeemer.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-he-did-what-he-did-so-we-could-have-what-he-is">2. He Did What He Did So We Could Have What He Is</h3>
<p>Christ’s death and resurrection were not just about forgiveness but impartation—sharing His divine life with us (2 Peter 1:4). This is the gospel’s radical promise:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justification</strong>: We are declared righteous (Romans 5:1).</li>
<li><strong>Sanctification</strong>: We are being remade into His image (Romans 8:29).</li>
<li><strong>Glorification</strong>: We will fully reflect Him in eternity (1 John 3:2).
As Major Thomas notes, the gospel is not merely a &ldquo;ticket to heaven&rdquo; but the means by which &ldquo;right now we may have what He is.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-we-must-have-what-he-is-to-be-what-he-was">3. We Must Have What He Is to Be What He Was</h3>
<p>Jesus lived as the perfect human—fully dependent on the Father (John 5:19). Likewise, our restored humanity hinges on His life in us:</p>
<ul>
<li>By Faith: &ldquo;Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Galatians 2:20).</li>
<li>By Surrender: &ldquo;Not I, but Christ&rdquo; (Galatians 2:20, Amplified).</li>
<li>By Power: &ldquo;Apart from Me, you can do nothing&rdquo; (John 15:5).
<strong>The gospel’s goal is Christlikeness—not self-improvement but divine exchange, His righteousness becomes my righteousness as we allow Him to be what He is in us.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-is-truly-good-news">Why This Is Truly Good News</h2>
<p>Many reduce the gospel to a one-time pardon, but Scripture presents it as an ongoing revolution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom from Performance</strong>: We don’t strive to earn God’s love; we receive it (Ephesians 2:8–9).</li>
<li><strong>Victory Over Sin</strong>: &ldquo;Sin shall not have dominion over you&rdquo; (Romans 6:14).</li>
<li><strong>Purpose in Suffering</strong>: Trials refine us to reflect Christ (1 Peter 4:12–13).
Paul’s declaration in Galatians 2:20 encapsulates this reality:
<em>&ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-we-need-the-whole-bible">Why We Need the Whole Bible</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genesis</strong> shows God’s original design.</li>
<li><strong>The Law</strong> reveals our need for grace.</li>
<li><strong>Prophets</strong> point to God’s faithfulness.</li>
<li><strong>Gospels</strong> display Christ’s perfect life.</li>
<li><strong>Epistles</strong> apply His teachings to daily life.</li>
<li><strong>Revelation</strong> assures ultimate victory.
Without Scripture, we lack the &ldquo;God-breathed&rdquo; wisdom (2 Timothy 3:16) to navigate life’s complexities. Without the Spirit, knowledge remains lifeless. Together, they transform us.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Bible is more than a book—it is God’s revelation of Himself, our purpose, and the path to restoration. Through Christ, we reclaim our identity as God’s image-bearers. As we study the Bible, we are not just informed but remade—conformed to the likeness of the One who is both our Creator and our Redeemer.</p>
