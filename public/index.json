Stedman and other biblical reflections\nA Relevant Story: The Mirror in the Rubble\nAfter a devastating earthquake, a young boy wandered through the ruins of his home. Amid the broken bricks and shattered glass, he found a small mirror, cracked but still reflecting light. He held it up to the sun and watched beams scatter across the rubble. “I can still make light,” he whispered.\nThat mirror, fractured yet still capable of reflecting something beautiful, is a fitting image for humanity in Genesis 1 – 11. These chapters tell the story of a world created in perfection, shattered by sin, and yet still reflecting the light of God’s purpose. They are not just the beginning of the Bible; they are the beginning of everything: creation, identity, rebellion, judgment, and the first glimpses of redemption.\nUniversality of Mankind\nGenesis opens with an awareness of the greatest material fact in human life: we live in a universe. Our planet orbits a sun, which belongs to a galaxy, which moves through a cosmos filled with billions of galaxies. And yet, in this vastness, Genesis 1:1 declares:\n“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”\nWhat a strange conjunction, to place the vast heavens on one side and our tiny planet on the other. Yet the Bible moves immediately to tell us that man is the major object of God’s concern.\nThe phrase “the heavens and the earth” speaks equally to the primitive villager and the modern astronomer. God has made the physical universe to reflect spiritual realities. As Dr. F. A. Filby said, “The material world is designed to produce parallels, parables, of the spiritual.” Nature teaches us about God; revelation brings us to Him.\nGranting this to be true, then the first truth God suggests to us—manifested in the material universe—is that there is a heavenly life as well as an earthly one. There is a difference between the life of God and the life of man. The supreme subject of the Bible will be how to move from the level of earth to the life of the heavens. As Isaiah declares:\n“‘For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,’ declares the Lord. ‘For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.’” (Isaiah 55:8–9)\nThat is the great truth with which, symbolically and cosmically, the Bible begins.\nThe Days of Creation: Genesis 1–2 in Detail\nGenesis 1 unfolds in six days of divine activity, followed by a seventh day of rest. Each day reveals physical formation and spiritual symbolism, a rhythm of separation, order, and purpose.\nEach of the six creative days (except the seventh) includes an evening and a morning—a rhythm that suggests incompleteness moving toward completeness. The evening comes first, symbolizing a period of obscurity and anticipation, followed by morning, the arrival of clarity and fulfillment. This pattern reflects the spiritual journey: from confusion to understanding, from brokenness to wholeness.\nHow should we view these days? Are they literal 24-hour periods, or symbolic of long epochs? While this debate has stirred much controversy, it’s important to recognize that Genesis 1 is not primarily concerned with chronology. The focus is not on how long creation took, but on what God was doing and why. He was moving toward a goal—step by step, stage by stage—each act building upon the last.\nMoreover, the physical things God creates are reflections of deeper spiritual realities. The universe is designed to teach us about the invisible kingdom of truth. Genesis 1 becomes a kind of table of contents for the rest of Scripture, introducing themes that will be developed throughout the Bible.\nDay 1: Light and Darkness (Genesis 1:3–5)\nThe earth begins as a formless, watery void wrapped in darkness. But the Spirit of God hovers over the waters, moving toward order. God says, “Let there be light,” and light appears, essential for life and symbolic of truth. This day teaches us a spiritual precedent: throughout our lives, we must learn to distinguish between what is good and what is not. Every sunrise and sunset reminds us of this truth.\nDay 2: Sky and Waters (Genesis 1:6–8)\nGod creates a firmament to separate the waters above from the waters below. Physically, this is the atmosphere around the Earth, which supports vast quantities of water in evaporated form above and separates it from the oceans below. Spiritually, it symbolizes the division between earthly life and heavenly life. The ocean and sky reflect two realms of existence, linked invisibly, yet distinct.\nIt is striking that the forgetfulness of the truths revealed in the first two creative days is at the root of much of the violence and moral decline in our time. Day one teaches us to distinguish between light and darkness—between good and evil, truth and error. Day two reminds us that this life is not all there is, and that we must prepare for the life to come. Yet modern culture increasingly blurs these distinctions. We seek instant gratification, immediate happiness, and resist the idea of future accountability or eternal purpose.\nBut every 24 hours, the rhythm of day and night, the presence of sky and sea, quietly preach these truths. They remind us that life is layered, that meaning is deeper than the moment, and that God is moving all things toward a goal. The second day of creation teaches us to lift our eyes, to see beyond the surface, and to live with eternity in view.\nDay 3: Land, Seas, and Vegetation (Genesis 1:9–13)\nDry land emerges from the waters, and life begins to grow: vegetation, seed-bearing plants, and fruit trees. Spiritually, this pictures the emergence of a new humanity from the old. The barren waters symbolize unregenerate humanity; the fruitful land represents those transformed by God. The three types of vegetation may reflect spiritual maturity: children, young men, and fathers (1 John 2:13). The progression is clear: life begins, multiplies, and matures.\nGod sees this fruitfulness and declares it good. It is pleasing to Him, not just because it is beautiful, but because it fulfills His purpose. The third day teaches us that fruitfulness is the mark of divine transformation. Where once there was only water and emptiness, now there is land and abundance.\nSpiritually, this day reminds us that God calls us out of barrenness into fruitfulness. He separates us from the old and plants us in the new. And when our lives begin to bear fruit—whether in character, service, or love—it is the evidence of His Spirit at work within us.\nDay 4: Sun, Moon, and Stars (Genesis 1:14–19)\nOn the fourth day, God said: “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.”\nGod sets the sun, moon, and stars in the sky—not merely as sources of light, but as instruments of rhythm, order, and meaning. They govern time, mark seasons, and illuminate the earth. But beyond their physical function, they carry profound spiritual symbolism.\nThe sun symbolizes Christ, “the sun of righteousness” (Malachi 4:2). He is the light of the world, the source of life, warmth, and clarity. The moon, reflecting the sun’s light, represents the church shining in a dark world. Stars symbolize believers who shine with moral influence (Daniel 12:3).\nDay 4 reminds us that God has placed lights in the world to guide, to govern, and to witness. The sun speaks of Christ’s supremacy, the moon of the church’s calling, and the stars of the faithful who illuminate others.\nThis day also reinforces the theme of divine order. The cosmos is not chaotic; it is calibrated. Seasons, days, and years unfold with precision, reflecting the intentionality of God’s design. And just as the physical heavens declare the glory of God (Psalm 19:1), so too do the spiritual lights He has placed among us.\nDay 4 teaches us to look up, not just to observe the sky, but to recognize the spiritual realities it reflects. It calls us to live as lights in the world, to reflect the glory of Christ, and to mark our lives by the rhythms of grace and truth.\nDay 5: Sea Creatures and Birds (Genesis 1:20–23)\nOn the fifth day, God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”\nGod fills the waters and skies with life. Birds and fish symbolize believers living in hostile environments. The spiritual life is alien to natural man, yet by God’s redemption, we can “mount up with wings like eagles” (Isaiah 40:31) and swim through the chaos of the world with grace. Birds, flying freely in the heavens, symbolize the redeemed life, lifted above earthly limitations. Fish, navigating the depths of the sea, represent believers living in the midst of a broken world. Though the sea is a hostile environment, they are equipped to thrive within it—just as the redeemed can live effectively in a fallen world, sustained by grace and guided by the Spirit.\nThis day also reinforces the theme of divine abundance. It is a picture of vitality, movement, and purpose, creation responding to the voice of God and filling the earth with His design.\nDay 6: Land Animals and Humanity (Genesis 1:24–31)\nDay 6 begins with the creation of land animals, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth.”\nFrom the larger beasts (called “the cattle”) to the creeping things—including insects, reptiles, and other small creatures—God fills the land with life. This progression is not random; it is clearly building toward a climax. The fossil record itself affirms this order: man appears last in the sequence of life.\nBut when man is created, something radically different happens. God holds a divine consultation: “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.” (Genesis 1:26)\nThis is the first hint in Scripture that God is more than one person—a triune being. And this revelation is given only in connection with the emergence of man, for only man can understand and enter into a relationship with a triune God. Man is the link between God and the rest of creation.\nThe first man, Adam, is a mediator between God and the animal world—just as the last Adam, Jesus Christ, will be the mediator between fallen humanity and God. Adam was made to reign over nature; Christ makes it possible for those in Him to reign in life (Romans 5:21).\nThe key phrase about man is that he is made in the “image” and “likeness” of God. This image is not found in man’s body or soul, but in his spirit. As Jesus told the woman at the well: “God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.” (John 4:24)\nWhat is godlike about our spirit? Genesis 1 suggests three divine capacities:\nGod creates – and so does man, through inventiveness and imagination. God communicates – and man uniquely shares ideas, emotions, and meaning. God evaluates – and man alone possesses moral awareness, discerning good from evil. These capacities mark the image of God in man. However, while man retains the image, he has lost the likeness. The image is the capacity to be godlike; the likeness is the proper functioning of that capacity. Adam, formed by the Creator, stood before God as a spirit dwelling in a body and exercising the functions of a soul. He was not only capable of creativity, communication, and moral judgment—he was actively doing them. He was functioning in God-likeness.\nThe secret of this likeness, as Scripture later reveals, lay in an inner dependence on God, a continual repudiation of self-confidence. Man was designed to live in intimate reliance on his Creator.\nDay 6 teaches us that humanity is not an evolutionary accident, but a divine appointment. We are made to reflect God, to relate to Him, and to reign with Him. And though the likeness has been lost through sin, the image remains—and through Christ, it can be restored.\nDay 7: Rest and Sanctification (Genesis 2:1–3)\nThe seventh day stands apart from all the others. Unlike the previous six, it is a day without an evening or a morning. There is no movement within it—no advance from incompleteness to completeness. Instead, it is a day characterized by rest. God ceased from His labours, not because He was weary, but because His work was finished. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy.\nThis rest is not merely physical—it is deeply spiritual. It is a picture of what Scripture later calls “the rest of faith.” As Hebrews 4:10 declares, “The one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.” This day has no evening or morning; it is eternal. True Sabbath is not inactivity, but trusting God to work through us.\nHere we see a revolutionary principle of human behaviour, one that God intended from the very beginning. It is the principle of human activity resting upon an indwelling God to produce extraordinary results. Man was never meant to live by striving alone, but by trusting in the presence and power of God within him.\nThis principle was lost in the fall, but it is restored in Jesus Christ. The weekly observance of the Sabbath is but a shadow, as Paul writes in Colossians 2:17, of this deeper reality: “The substance belongs to Christ.”\nTrue Sabbath-keeping is not about ritual or regulation; it is about learning to labour from a place of rest. It means allowing God to work in and through what we do, trusting His strength rather than our own. He who learns to live and labour on those terms is keeping the Sabbath as God originally intended.\nDay 7 teaches us that rest is not the absence of work, it is the presence of trust. It is the culmination of creation, the rhythm of grace, and the invitation to live in communion with the Creator. In this rest, we find not only peace, but purpose.\nGenesis 2: The Garden and the Breath of Life\nGenesis 2 shifts from cosmic scope to intimate detail. It zooms in on human intimacy and identity. Man is formed from dust, and God breathes life into him. He is placed in a garden, not merely to exist, but to walk in communion with God, functioning as a spirit within a physical body and manifesting the personality characteristics of the soul.\nAt this point, God gives man a unique assignment—a kind of research project. Adam is invited to investigate the animal world in search of a suitable counterpart to himself. God knows Adam will not find what he’s looking for, but the process is instructive. Adam learns three profound truths:\nA woman is not a beast of burden. Unlike the animals, she is not created to serve or carry loads. That would not fulfill Adam’s need for a helper and companion. A woman is not merely a biological laboratory. While animals use sex solely for reproduction, Adam realizes that human sexuality is designed for something deeper—intimacy, unity, and mutual delight. A woman is not something outside of man. She is not an object to be used and discarded. She is a helper fit for him—corresponding to him in essence and dignity. God creates woman from Adam’s rib, symbolizing equality and unity. Their relationship touches not just the conscious mind, but the subconscious and unconscious. Genesis 2 ends with four principles of marriage:\nIdentity: “The two shall become one.” Marriage involves a complete blending of lives—not instantaneously, but gradually, as a couple lives together, merges their histories, and forms a shared identity. Headship: Man is given the role of leadership in the home—not as domination, but as direction. The woman’s role is to support and sustain that leadership in mutual love and respect. Permanence: “A man shall cleave to his wife.” Marriage is a lasting bond, not a temporary arrangement. It is a covenant of commitment. Openness: “The man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.” This speaks of transparency, vulnerability, and free communication—hallmarks of a healthy relationship. Genesis 2 teaches us that human relationships are sacred, intentional, and deeply spiritual. It affirms that companionship is not a luxury; it is a divine provision. And it reminds us that marriage, at its best, reflects the unity, creativity, and love of the God who made us.\nGenesis 3: The Fall, the Fracture, and the First Promise\nGenesis 3 explains the origin of sin and suffering. The tempter, likely a “shining one”, distorts truth, arouses desire, and leads Eve to rationalize disobedience. Adam follows, and death enters.\nFour marks of death appear:\nShame: They realize they are naked. Hiding: Guilt drives them from God. Blame: They shift responsibility, even to God. Limits: Pain, toil, and mortality begin. Yet grace appears. God clothes them with animal skins, a picture of substitutionary sacrifice. They are banished not to block the tree of life, but to guard the way to it. Jesus later declares, “I am the way.” The life path is spiritual, not physical.\nGenesis 3 follows a redemptive arc:\nTemptation Death Repentance Grace Healing Genesis 4–8: The Foundations of Human Society and the Collapse of Civilization\nChapters 4 through 8 of Genesis trace the earliest human history—not as myth, but as a meaningful record. There was a real Cain, a genuine 40-day deluge, a solid gopherwood ark, and an actual tower of babbling confusion. These events are not only historical; they are profoundly instructive. They reveal the principles on which humanity has built its society—and the inherent flaws that have led to its repeated collapse.\nHistory, as we know it, is the chronicle of man’s progress from primitive tools to nuclear weapons. It is the story of war, bloodshed, and brokenness. And the key to this long dilemma lies in the story of two brothers: Cain and Abel.\nCain and Abel: The Roots of Violence\nThe focus of Genesis 4 is the offerings brought by Cain and Abel. Abel’s offering—a lamb—is accepted; Cain’s grain offering is rejected. Commentators rightly note that Cain’s was a bloodless offering, and “without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness” (Hebrews 9:22). But Cain’s deeper failure was his refusal to repent. Anger consumed him, and jealousy led to murder. The ax rose, Abel fell, and the first human death was not natural—it was fratricide.\nHere lie the roots of human warfare: jealousy, pride, and the unwillingness to forgive. Cain’s contemptuous question—“Am I my brother’s keeper?”—echoes through history. The blood of Abel cries out for justice, and God responds by cursing the ground Cain once cultivated with joy. Yet even in judgment, grace appears. God places a mark on Cain—not of shame, but of mercy: “This man is still mine.”\nThe Rise of Civilization and the Spread of Corruption\nCain’s son Enoch builds a city—on ground still red with Abel’s blood. Within this city, we see the beginnings of culture: travel, music, metallurgy, politics, and domestication. But these achievements rest on shaky foundations. Polygamy emerges with Lamech. Violence is justified. The state begins to replace the family. Urban life overtakes rural simplicity. Sexual excess is tolerated.\nYet God’s redemptive plan continues. Adam and Eve have another son, Seth (“appointed”), through whom a godly line is traced. In Genesis 5, a remarkable sequence of names tells a hidden story of grace:\n“It is appointed that mortal man shall sorrow, but the blessed God came down teaching that His death shall bring strength and comfort.”\nThe chapter centers on Enoch, who “walked with God.” In a brilliant but wicked age, one man learned to live in fellowship with the Creator.\nGenesis 6: The Collapse of Civilization\nGenesis 6 introduces the “sons of God” who marry the “daughters of men,” producing the Nephilim—a race of giants. Jude suggests these “sons of God” were angels who abandoned their proper abode, possessing human bodies and corrupting the human race. The Nephilim (“fallen ones”) reflect the mythic memory of half-gods and half-men.\nBut God sets a limit: 120 years. During this time, Noah becomes a preacher of righteousness. The marks of a collapsing civilization are clear:\nDemonic influence Unchecked violence Deep inner corruption (“every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually”) God announces judgment and commands Noah to build an ark—a vessel of safety amid impending catastrophe.\nThe Ark and the Flood: Judgment and New Beginning\nNoah obeys, entering the ark with his family and pairs of animals. The distinction between clean and unclean animals is symbolic—teaching spiritual truths through physical traits. Clean animals reflect qualities God loves; unclean ones reflect traits He disapproves of.\nThen the flood comes. The fountains of the deep burst forth, the windows of heaven open, and the earth is submerged—even the mountains. All life perishes except those in the ark and marine creatures. The rain lasts 40 days and nights. After 150 days, the waters begin to recede.\nOn the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark comes to rest on the mountains of Ararat. This date is deeply symbolic. Centuries later, Jesus would rise from the dead on the seventeenth day of the first month—after God changed the calendar at the Exodus. In the old reckoning, this is the same day. Thus, Noah’s emergence from the ark is a picture of resurrection—a new beginning of life, just as every Christian experiences through the new birth in Christ.\nGenesis 4–8 reveals the tragic trajectory of human society: from worship to murder, from cities to corruption, from demonic influence to divine judgment. But it also reveals the persistent thread of grace. In Cain’s mark, in Seth’s line, in Enoch’s walk, in Noah’s obedience, and in the ark’s resting place—we see that God is always preparing a way back to life.\nGenesis 9–11: Covenant, Corruption, and Dispersion\nGenesis 9 opens with one of the major covenants of the Bible, a covenant made with Noah, but extending to all humanity. It is the foundation for human government and the ordering of society. God establishes a framework for life after the flood, acknowledging the persistent reality that “the intent of man’s heart is evil from his youth” (Genesis 8:21), yet choosing to work through grace and structure.\nThe Noahic Covenant: Order After Chaos\nThis covenant includes several key provisions:\nDependable nature: Secured by the promise of the rainbow, God assures that universal catastrophe will not return in the same form. Dominion through fear: Man’s rule over animals is now mediated by fear, and animals are given as food alongside plants. Sanctity of life: Human life is declared sacred. Only God has the right to take it, but He delegates authority to the state, laying the foundation for police work and capital punishment. Cultural mandate: Once again, humanity is commanded to multiply and fill the earth. This covenant is not merely ceremonial—it is practical, establishing the moral and civil framework for human society.\nNoah’s Drunkenness and the Blessing of Sons\nThe strange episode of Noah’s drunkenness and Ham’s response carries deep significance. Many scholars suggest Ham’s act had sexual connotations—at the very least, it involved a leering, dishonorable gaze. In contrast, Shem and Japheth refuse to look upon their father’s shame, covering him in love and respect. They embody the New Testament principle: “Love covers a multitude of sins.” (1 Peter 4:8)\nNoah, guided by divine insight, discerns that Ham’s tolerance of perversion will manifest in one of his sons. He curses Canaan—not with skin colour, as some have wrongly claimed, but with a tendency toward sexual immorality, which later defines the Canaanite tribes.\nIn Noah’s prophetic words, we find a key to the dispersion of mankind:\nShem is given religious primacy. The Semitic peoples—Judaism, Islam, and Christianity—carry the spiritual legacy. Japheth is promised enlargement. These people populate Europe, India, and the Americas, fulfilling the prophecy of geographic expansion. Ham is assigned a servant role—not as slaves, but as practical technicians and inventors. The Egyptians, Babylonians, Mayans, and Aztecs—all Hamitic—contribute foundational technologies and cultural advancements. Genesis 10: The Table of Nations\nChapter 10 narrows the flow of history to the Semitic races. It traces the genealogies of Noah’s sons and sets the stage for the next great narrowing—to one man, Abraham. From this point, the Bible will focus on Abraham and his descendants, both physical and spiritual. These chapters form one of the most important links in understanding the entire biblical narrative.\nThe atmosphere is one of movement and migration. Humanity spreads out like spokes from a wheel, radiating into the corners of the earth.\nGenesis 11: The Tower of Babel\nOne branch of the Hamitic family settles in Shinar (Babylonia) and begins to build two things: a city and a tower. The city reflects man’s social hunger, for beauty, art, music, commerce, and community. The tower reflects man’s spiritual ambition.\nArchaeologists have uncovered ziggurats—spiral towers with shrines at the top, often inscribed with zodiac signs. Though they bore plaques claiming to glorify God, their true purpose was to control God—to use Him for human glory. This is revealed in the builders’ words:\n“Let us make a name for ourselves.”\nGod’s response is one of exquisite irony. He acknowledges their unity and creativity:\n“Nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.” (Genesis 11:6)\nSo, for man’s own protection, God confuses their language and scatters them across the earth. This divine intervention prevents the ultimate catastrophe—humanity united in ignorant ambition, believing it can master the mechanisms of life without God.\nGenesis 9–11 reveals the tension between divine order and human pride. It shows us that civilization, though impressive, is fragile when built on rebellion. Yet even in dispersion, God is preparing a redemptive plan—one that will begin with Abraham and ultimately restore what was lost in Eden.\nThe Purpose of Genesis 1–11\nGenesis 1–11 is not merely a record of ancient events; it is the theological foundation for everything that follows in Scripture. These chapters explain why the world is both breathtaking and broken. They reveal the origin of creation, the nature of humanity, the entrance of sin, the rise of civilization, and the persistent thread of divine grace.\nThey also introduce the major themes that will echo throughout the rest of the Bible:\nCreation and Order – God brings light out of darkness, form out of formlessness, and purpose out of chaos. Fall and Judgment – Humanity rebels, and the consequences are profound: shame, guilt, death, and dispersion. Grace and Redemption – Even in judgment, God provides a way back, through sacrifice, covenant, and promise. Covenant and Calling – God begins to narrow His redemptive plan, preparing to call one man, Abraham, through whom all nations will be blessed. Genesis 1–11 also teaches us how to interpret the world around us. It shows that nature and revelation are complementary sources of truth. It affirms that human history is not random, but purposeful. And it reminds us that every sunrise, every storm, every act of creativity or conscience is a reflection of deeper spiritual realities.\nThese chapters are not just the prologue to the Bible; they are the prologue to our lives. They explain our longing, our brokenness, our questions. They show us that we were made for more and that God has not abandoned us.\nAs the story narrows to Abraham in Genesis 12, the focus shifts from universal history to personal covenant. But the foundation has been laid. The rest of Scripture will build upon these truths, leading us from Eden to Calvary, from the flood to the cross, from Babel to Pentecost, and ultimately from death to resurrection.\nGenesis 1 – 11 is the beginning of that restoration. It is the first chapter in the greatest story ever told.\nSo What?\nGenesis 1–11 is not just ancient history, it’s our story. It explains:\nWhy we long for meaning Why we struggle with guilt and shame Why society rises and collapses Why we need redemption It teaches us that we are not random accidents, but intentional creations. That our brokenness is real, but not final. That God’s grace is woven through every chapter, even in judgment, He prepares a way back.\nThese chapters call us to:\nLive with discernment between light and darkness Embrace our identity as image-bearers of God Trust in the rest that comes from faith Walk with God in a fractured world Build lives not on pride, but on dependence Genesis 1 – 11 is the foundation of everything. It is the beginning of the gospel. It is the mirror in the rubble, still catching light, still pointing upward.\nA Final Story: The Tree and the Way\nA traveller once wandered into a desert, parched and weary. In the distance, he saw a tree, green, vibrant, alive. Beneath it flowed a hidden spring. As he drank, he noticed a path winding from the tree toward the horizon. A sign read:\n“This is the way to life.”\nThat tree is the tree of life. That path is the way of faith. Genesis 1 – 11 ends not with despair, but with direction. The way is guarded, yes, but it is not closed. It is opened again through Christ, who said:\n“I am the way, the truth, and the life.”\nThe journey begins here. The rest of Scripture is the unfolding of that path.\nResources:\nThomas, W.H. Griffith. Methods of Bible Study. New York: Association Press, 1911.\nMorgan, G. Campbell.

She’s not expecting company, especially not a Jewish man who would speak to her. But Jesus does. He asks for a drink, then offers her something far greater: “living water.” In that moment, her story changes. She runs back to her village, no longer hiding, proclaiming, “Come see a man who told me everything I ever did!”\nThis encounter in John 4 isn’t just a touching moment; it’s the heartbeat of the New Testament. It captures the essence of its message: Jesus meets people where they are, offers transformation, and turns shame into purpose.\nTo truly grasp the depth of this moment and the New Testament as a whole, we must understand its foundation in the Old Testament. As discussed in the previous overview, the New Testament reveals the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan in Jesus Christ, while the Old Testament serves as the essential foundation. It is a divine preparation that creates the framework for understanding Christ’s coming.\nThrough prophecies, sacrifices, and deep spiritual longings, the Old Testament follows a progressive pattern. It contains “the shadow of the good things to come” (Hebrews 10:1), which find their substance in Christ. It points forward to the Messiah, building anticipation and revealing humanity’s need for salvation.\nThe Old Testament has a magnificent ability to focus this longing in definable terms and help us see what it is we are truly searching for. As we read the lives of old men and women of faith, we find ourselves saying, “Ah, that’s it! That is what I need.” When we open the Psalms, they speak to us from the deep experience of the human heart, and we say, “That is what I want. That is what I mean to say. That is the need of my life and heart.” This is why the Old Testament is so essential to us.\nSurely this is why many today who read only the New Testament can only go so far in grasping the fullness that is in Jesus Christ, because their hearts are not adequately prepared. Our lives remain shallow and limited when we try to grasp truths we’re not yet ready to understand. This is why we need so deeply and continuously the ministry of the Old Testament: to prepare, to awaken, and to deepen our capacity for Christ.\nIf the Old Testament prepares, then the New Testament fulfills. It is designed to meet the needs created and expressed by the Old Testament. It does so by unveiling to our hungry hearts the One who was sent to meet human needs. Jesus said:\n“If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.” (John 7:37) “If anyone eats of this bread (referring to himself), he will live forever.” (John 6:58) “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28) “He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” (John 8:12) All the needs the human heart can conceive of are met in Him. The purpose of the New Testament is to be a channel by which the Holy Spirit, illuminating the pages as we read, makes the living Jesus Christ real to our hearts.\nAnother verse in Hebrews sums up the whole New Testament in one brief phrase. In Hebrews 2, the writer states that all the earth was to be subjected to man and that God intended that man should be in dominion over it. We read in verse 8:\n“Now in putting everything in subjection to man, He (God) left nothing outside his control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.” (Hebrews 2:8b)\nThat is an accurate statement of the present situation. As we look around, we do not yet see much of anything in subjection to man. This is the problem, isn’t it? Why don’t things work out the way we think they should? Why is there always a fly in the ointment? Why is it that even our fondest dreams, when they are realized, are never as glorious as we anticipated?\n“We do not yet see everything in subjection to him.” The stamp of rebellion and futility is upon everything we touch. This is the present situation. But the writer goes on:\n“But we see Jesus\u0026hellip;” (Hebrews 2:9a)\nThere is the answer. But we see Jesus. That is the New Testament, the summary of its message to our hearts. We do not yet see everything in subjection. But the story has not ended. The whole tale has not been told. What we do see is the One who will make it possible. We see Jesus. And in the New Testament, He stands out on every page.\nReason and Revelation: Two Lenses of Truth\nThe New Testament invites us to engage both reason and revelation. Reason helps us explore the historical, literary, and theological dimensions of Scripture. Revelation, through the Holy Spirit, opens our hearts to divine truth. As Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 2, “no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.”\nWithout the Spirit, Scripture remains a closed book. But when illuminated, it becomes a living word, piercing, healing, and transforming.\nThe Purpose: Transformation, Not Information\nThe New Testament is not merely a collection of doctrines or moral teachings. Its goal is transformation. As Paul writes in Romans 12:2, we are called to be “transformed by the renewing of your mind.” The Scriptures shape our identity, renew our thinking, and call us into a life of love, holiness, and purpose.\nAs we have been seeing together in this series, the purpose of all revelation is directly concerned with us. It is so that we, as Paul puts it in Ephesians 4, may come to “mature manhood” (Ephesians 4:13 RSV) in Christ. As he goes on to say, it is so that we will stop being babies, stop being children in kindergarten, playing around with the ABCs of life. It is so that we will begin to grasp life with such vitality and vigour of purpose that we begin to grow as God intended us to grow, until we come at last to the full expression of Jesus Christ, living in us.\nThe purpose of all revelation is to fulfill God\u0026rsquo;s original intention in creating the world and the universe in the first place, that we might be a body wholly filled and flooded with God Himself. Anything short of this is a failure to realize what God has provided.\nStructure of the New Testament\nThe New Testament consists of 27 books, grouped into four major sections, each serving a distinct purpose in revealing the person and work of Jesus Christ and the implications for humanity.\n1. The Gospels - The Life and Ministry of Jesus\nMatthew presents Jesus as the Messianic King, fulfilling Old Testament prophecy. Mark portrays Jesus as the Suffering Servant, emphasizing action and sacrifice. Luke emphasizes Jesus as the Son of Man, compassionate and inclusive. John reveals Jesus as the Son of God, focusing on His divine identity and spiritual depth. Together, the Gospels reveal who Jesus is, what He taught, and why His life, death, and resurrection matter.\n2. Acts - The Birth and Expansion of the Church\nActs bridges the Gospels and Epistles, chronicling the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the explosive growth of the early Church. It shows how the gospel moved from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth, fulfilling Jesus’ command to “be my witnesses” (Acts 1:8).\n3. The Epistles - The Theology and Practice of Christian Life\nWritten by apostles to churches and individuals, these letters provide doctrinal depth, ethical instruction, and pastoral encouragement. They guide believers in living out the gospel in daily life, in community, and in the face of trials.\n4. Revelation - The Consummation of God’s Plan\nRevelation offers a prophetic vision of Christ’s ultimate victory and the renewal of creation. Though filled with imagery, it provides profound comfort: Jesus wins, and those who belong to Him will reign with Him forever.\nSo What?\nWhy does this matter?\nBecause we live in a world of restless searching, chasing success, relationships, experiences, and meaning. The New Testament speaks directly to that ache. It doesn’t offer a philosophy or a checklist. It offers a Person. Jesus doesn’t just answer our questions; He becomes the answer.\nThrough Him, we find:\nIdentity: We are no longer defined by failure or fear, but by grace and adoption. Purpose: We are called to live as agents of reconciliation and hope. Hope: Not just for eternity, but for today—for every moment of doubt, pain, and longing. The woman at the well didn’t leave with a theological treatise. She left with a testimony. That’s the power of the New Testament—it turns seekers into witnesses.\nA Final Story: The Man on the Mat\nHe had been paralyzed for years, lying on a mat, dependent on others for everything. One day, his friends carried him to a crowded house where Jesus was teaching. Unable to get through the door, they climbed to the roof, tore it open, and lowered him down. Everyone watched. Jesus looked at the man and said, “Your sins are forgiven.” Then, to prove His authority, He added, “Get up, take your mat, and walk.”\nAnd he did.\nThis story from Mark 2 is more than a miracle; it’s a declaration. The New Testament isn’t just about physical healing; it’s about spiritual restoration. Jesus doesn’t just fix what’s broken, He redefines what it means to be whole. The man walked out carrying the very mat that once carried him, a living testimony to grace, faith, and the power of Christ.\nThat’s the invitation of the New Testament: to rise, walk, and live transformed.\nResources:\nThomas, W.H.

Last time, we explored the purpose of God’s revelation in the Bible, to mature us as believers into the complete expression of Jesus Christ. The entire Bible is necessary for this transformation, with the Holy Spirit helping us understand it.\nWhile the New Testament reveals the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan in Jesus Christ, the Old Testament serves as the essential foundation, a divine preparation that creates the framework for understanding Christ’s coming. Through prophecies, sacrifices, and deep spiritual longings, the Old Testament follows a progressive pattern, with the Old Testament containing \u0026ldquo;the shadow of the good things to come\u0026rdquo; (Hebrews 10:1) that find their substance in Christ and points forward to the Messiah, building anticipation and revealing humanity’s need for salvation.\nThe Road to Emmaus: A Story of Burning Hearts\nIn Luke 24, two disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus’ resurrection. They were heartbroken and confused after His crucifixion. While they walked and talked, Jesus Himself approached them, unrecognized, and asked what they were discussing.\nThey explained the tragic events, how Jesus of Nazareth, whom they had hoped was the Messiah, had been crucified. They mentioned strange rumours that His tomb was empty, but they didn’t know what to believe.\nJesus responded, “O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!” Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He showed them how the Scriptures pointed to Him.\nLater, they recalled: “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?”\nThis is the heart of the Old Testament’s role: to stir anticipation, awaken faith, and prepare us to meet Christ.\nThe Old Testament: Unfinished by Design\nDr. W. H. Griffith Thomas once suggested that if we read the Old Testament without knowing the New, we’d notice:\n1. Unfulfilled Prophecy\nFrom Genesis onward, prophecies unfold pointing toward a promised figure. These grow richer in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Malachi, yet the identity of the One foretold remains unrevealed.\n2. Unexplained Sacrifices\nA stream of blood flows through the Old Testament, from Abel’s offering to the temple sacrifices. Yet the meaning behind this repeated shedding of blood remains unresolved.\n3. Unsatisfied Longings\nFrom Abraham searching for a city “whose builder and maker is God” to the cries in Psalms and Ecclesiastes, we see human hearts yearning for something beyond the present world.\nBy the end of Malachi, the reader is left with tension and expectation, a story unfinished.\nThen comes the New Testament:\n“The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ\u0026hellip;”\nHe is the One who fulfills the prophecy, explains the sacrifice, and satisfies the longing.\nThe Old Testament’s Threefold Cry\nDr. G. Campbell Morgan described the Old Testament in three major cries:\n• A sigh for a priest - The Law reveals man’s need for a mediator.\n• A cry for a king - The Historical books reveal the longing for righteous leadership.\n• A quest for a prophet - The Wisdom and Prophetic books seek a voice to interpret life and unveil the future.\nEach of these cries finds its answer in Jesus Christ, our perfect Priest, King, and Prophet.\nWhy the Old Testament is Essential for Understanding the New\nHebrews 1:1–2 contrasts the Old and New Testaments: \u0026ldquo;In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Old Testament speaks with diverse voices:\n• The majestic creation accounts of Genesis,\n• The lives of the patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\n• The thundering of the laws in Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy,\n• The drama of the historical books,\n• The poetic cries of the Psalms,\n• The exalted visions of the Prophets,\n• The wise sayings of Proverbs,\n• The mysteries of Ezekiel and Daniel,\n• The delicate tenderness of the Song of Solomon, Ruth, and Esther.\nYet, the Old Testament always speaks in phrases and glimpses. It points forward but never fully satisfies. In Christ, all the fragmented voices of the Old Testament merge into a single, glorious voice.\nWhy the Old Testament Is Essential\nSome might think, \u0026ldquo;Why not skip the Old Testament and just start with Jesus?\u0026rdquo;\nBut skipping preparation leads to shallow understanding.\nJesus Himself said that if people would not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they would not be convinced even by someone rising from the dead (Luke 16:31).\nSimilarly, just as a field must be plowed before planting, the human heart must be tilled by the Old Testament before the seed of Christ can fully take root.\nThe Old Testament reveals humanity’s failure, longing, and need, setting the stage for Christ’s complete answer.\nA True Story: The Power of Isaiah\nDr. H. A. Ironside once met a young man in San Bernardino who, though skeptical of Christianity, was captivated by the eloquence of Isaiah. Reading Isaiah 53, which portrays a suffering figure bearing the sins of others, moved him deeply. When Ironside asked him who Isaiah 53 described, the young man realized it was about Jesus.\nLater, the young man testified that he once cursed at Gordon’s Calvary in Jerusalem, furious at the \u0026ldquo;Christian myth.\u0026rdquo; But after encountering Isaiah’s prophecy, he recognized that the one he had cursed was actually the One who died for his sins.\nIt was the Old Testament, not argument or philosophy, that prepared his heart.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Old Testament is an experience book. It expresses humanity’s struggles with injustice, pain, and longing. The Psalms especially give voice to every human emotion. Without the Old Testament, the New Testament’s message would seem abrupt and disconnected.\nThe Old Testament gives Christmas its anticipation (\u0026ldquo;Unto us a child is born\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;), Good Friday its meaning (\u0026ldquo;He was wounded for our transgressions\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;), and Easter its triumph.\nUltimately, the Old Testament exists to awaken our need, to stir our longing, and to ready our hearts for the glorious arrival of Christ, the fulfillment of all prophecy, sacrifice, and hope.\nConclusion: From Shadows to Substance\nThe Old Testament is not a collection of outdated stories; it is God’s deliberate preparation for the New. Like scattered puzzle pieces forming a complete picture, its prophecies, sacrifices, and longings find their fulfillment in Jesus. The Old Testament sets our hearts aflame with divine anticipation, ensuring that when we meet Christ in the Gospels, we recognize Him as the answer to all of God’s promises. To neglect the Old Testament is to miss the depth of God’s redemptive plan—one that begins in Genesis and culminates in Revelation.\nResources:\nThomas, W.H. Griffith. Methods of Bible Study.

This article is the first in a series that will explore each book of the Bible, one by one. But before we dive into individual overviews, we begin here with the big picture: an overview of the Bible as a whole. This foundational piece sets the stage for understanding how each book fits into the grand narrative of Scripture and how the entire Bible reveals God\u0026rsquo;s heart and plan for the world.\nIntroduction: A Story of Discovery\nImagine a young explorer, eager to uncover the secrets of an ancient civilization. He stumbles upon a dusty, old map hidden in a forgotten library. This map promises to lead him to a treasure beyond his wildest dreams. But there\u0026rsquo;s a catch – the map is complex, filled with symbols and paths that seem impossible to decipher without guidance. Realizing this, the explorer understands he needs a mentor to interpret the map and help him navigate the journey.\nIn many ways, we are like that young explorer, and the Bible is our map. It promises to lead us to the greatest treasure of all – a deep, fulfilling relationship with God. But to truly understand it, we need guidance and a willingness to embark on the journey.\nThe Inadequacy of Man without God\nThe Bible, with its 66 books written over fifteen centuries by more than forty authors, presents a coherent theme: the story of man and his relationship with God. It reveals a profound truth – without God, we are incomplete. This inadequacy is evident in three realms:\nNatural Relationships: Our understanding of the physical world – cosmology, geology, biology – is limited without acknowledging the Creator. Think about the vastness of the universe, the intricate details of our planet, and the complexity of life itself. Without God, these wonders remain mysteries, and our understanding is superficial. Human Relationships: Our interactions with others – sociology, psychology, psychiatry – fall short without the love and guidance of God. Consider the conflicts, misunderstandings, and broken relationships that plague our world. Without God\u0026rsquo;s love and wisdom, we struggle to find true harmony and peace with one another. Spiritual Relationships: Our connection with God – theology, soteriology, philosophy – is essential for true fulfillment. Without God, we are like a ship without a compass, drifting aimlessly through life, searching for meaning and purpose. Without God, we struggle to understand the world, ourselves, and our purpose. We are like that young explorer, lost without a mentor to guide us.\nThe Adequacy of Man with God\nThe Bible does not merely expose our inadequacy, it presents the remedy: Christ Himself. Through Him, we are restored to what God intended us to be. Christ didn’t just come to model righteousness, He came to make righteousness possible for us. He is the very presence of God, stepping into human history to restore what was broken. Imagine a king wanting to rescue his people. He could send messengers, but instead, He steps down from His throne, becomes one of them, and leads them home Himself. His incarnation wasn’t just about showing us how to live; it was about making a way for us to be reunited with the Father. Through His sacrifice, He bridged the gap between humanity and God, offering us a new life. “Christ in us, and us in Christ” speaks to the deep spiritual transformation and identity we receive through Him. Through Christ, we are forgiven and made new. His Spirit fills us, guiding and transforming us.\nWith Christ in us—His life transforming ours—and us in Christ—abiding in His presence and identity—we can experience fullness in every realm of life:\nSovereignty over Nature: Christ demonstrated mastery over creation, not only walking on water and calming storms, but also feeding multitudes and restoring the broken. When we are in Him and He in us, our perspective on nature shifts; we move from exploiting creation to stewarding it as God intended, embracing responsibility and harmony with His world. Peace in Human Relationships: Without Christ, human relationships are fractured, marked by selfishness and conflict. But in Christ, we are made new, empowered to love, forgive, and extend grace as He did. Just as Jesus healed relationships, whether restoring Peter after his denial or reconciling enemies through the cross, we, in Him, can experience deep reconciliation, breaking cycles of division and strife. Supreme Happiness in Spiritual Relationships: Christ Himself declared, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). Without Him, we are lost in confusion and longing. But when He dwells in us, and we abide in Him, our souls find purpose, peace, and joy—not fleeting happiness, but true fulfillment in communion with God. This is our calling—to be transformed by Him, dwelling in Him, and allowing Him to reshape every aspect of our lives. Christ is more than an example; He is our life (Galatians 2:20), the One through whom we become all that God intended. He is our mentor, guiding us through the complexities of life.\nThe Purpose of the Bible\nSo, why did God give us the Bible? What is its ultimate purpose? The Bible itself provides the answer. In Ephesians, Paul explains that God plans to bring unity and maturity in faith, leading us to Christlikeness. The Bible equips us for every good work, helping us grow into the people God created us to be.\nConsider these passages from Ephesians:\nEphesians 1:9-12: \u0026ldquo;With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ. In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.\u0026rdquo; Ephesians 3:10-12: \u0026ldquo;His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In him and through faith in him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence.\u0026rdquo; Ephesians 4:11-13: \u0026ldquo;So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.\u0026rdquo; These passages highlight God\u0026rsquo;s purpose to bring us to unity and maturity in faith, leading us to Christlikeness. The Bible is our guide, helping us grow in faith and understanding, equipping us for the journey ahead.\nThe Gospel – The Good News of the Bible\nThe gospel is not just about forgiveness; it\u0026rsquo;s about living a fulfilled life through Christ. Major Ian Thomas, the founder of the Torchbearers Bible schools, beautifully summarizes this: \u0026ldquo;We must have what he is to be what he was.\u0026rdquo; By allowing Christ to live through us, we can experience the fullness of life that God intended.\nThink about it – Jesus lived a perfect life, demonstrating love, compassion, and righteousness in every situation. He faced the same challenges and temptations that we do, yet he remained sinless. By allowing Christ to live through us, we experience the fullness of life that God intended.\nThe gospel, or \u0026ldquo;good news,\u0026rdquo; is the heart of the Bible\u0026rsquo;s message. It tells us that God loves us so much that He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to live among us, to die for our sins, and to rise again, conquering death and offering us eternal life. This is the ultimate expression of God\u0026rsquo;s love and grace.\nThe Good News of Forgiveness\nFirst and foremost, the gospel is about forgiveness. We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). Our sins separate us from God, creating a barrier that we cannot overcome on our own. But God, in His infinite love and mercy, provided a way for us to be reconciled to Him. Through the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross, our sins are forgiven, and we are made right with God.\nImagine carrying a heavy burden, a weight that you cannot lift on your own. The gospel tells us that Jesus has taken that burden upon Himself, freeing us from the weight of our sins. This forgiveness is not something we can earn; it is a gift of grace, freely given to all who believe in Jesus Christ.\nThe Good News of Transformation\nBut the gospel doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop at forgiveness. It also promises transformation. When we accept Jesus as our Savior, we are not only forgiven but also made new. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, \u0026ldquo;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!\u0026rdquo; This means our old, sinful nature is replaced with a new, Christlike nature.\nThis transformation is a lifelong process, known as sanctification. As we grow in our relationship with Christ, we become more like Him. The Holy Spirit works in us, changing our hearts and minds, helping us to live in a way that honours God. This transformation is evident in our actions, our attitudes, and our relationships with others.\nThe Good News of Purpose\nThe gospel also gives us a sense of purpose. Before we knew Christ, we may have felt lost, wandering through life without direction. But in Christ, we find our true purpose. Ephesians 2:10 tells us, \u0026ldquo;For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\u0026rdquo;\nGod has a plan for each of our lives, a unique purpose that only we can fulfill. As we walk with Him, He reveals His plan to us, guiding us and equipping us to do the good works He has prepared for us. This purpose gives our lives meaning and direction, filling us with a sense of fulfillment and joy.\nThe Good News of Eternal Life\nFinally, the gospel promises eternal life. Jesus said in John 11:25-26, \u0026ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.\u0026rdquo; This means that death is not the end for those who believe in Christ. We have the hope of eternal life with God, a life free from pain, suffering, and sin.\nThis promise of eternal life gives us hope and comfort, especially in times of trial and loss. It reminds us that our time on earth is temporary and that we have a glorious future awaiting us in heaven. This hope sustains us, giving us the strength to persevere through life\u0026rsquo;s challenges.\nThe Importance of the Bible\nTo truly understand and live out the good news of the gospel, we need the Bible. It provides guidance through the stories of faith, the Law, the Prophets, the Gospels, the Epistles, and Revelation. It reveals God\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and ways, helping us navigate the complexities of life.\nConsider the following:\nThe Stories of Faith: The lives of David, Ruth, Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Mary, Paul, Peter, and others show us how God works in specific situations. Their stories encourage us and provide practical examples of faith in action. For instance, David\u0026rsquo;s courage in facing Goliath teaches us about trusting God in the face of overwhelming odds. Ruth\u0026rsquo;s loyalty and faithfulness demonstrate the power of love and commitment. Abraham\u0026rsquo;s journey of faith shows us the importance of obedience and trust in God\u0026rsquo;s promises. The Law: The Law helps us understand what God expects of us and reveals our need for a Saviour. It shows us our guilt and helplessness, pointing us to Christ. The Ten Commandments, for example, provide a moral framework that guides our behaviour and relationships. They remind us of our need for God\u0026rsquo;s grace and forgiveness, as we inevitably fall short of His standards. The Prophets: The Prophets provide a broader picture of God\u0026rsquo;s plan, offering hope and assurance that God is working all things out for our good. They call us to repentance and remind us of God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness and justice. The prophecies of Isaiah, for example, foretell the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. These messages of hope and restoration encourage us to trust in God\u0026rsquo;s promises, even in difficult times. The Gospels: The Gospels reveal the perfect life of Jesus Christ, showing us what it means to live in complete dependence on God. They provide a detailed account of Jesus\u0026rsquo; teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection. Through the Gospels, we learn about Jesus\u0026rsquo; compassion for the marginalized, His commitment to truth and justice, and His sacrificial love for humanity. These accounts inspire us to follow His example and live out our faith in practical ways. The Epistles: The Epistles translate the truths of the Gospels into practical daily situations, helping us apply God\u0026rsquo;s Word to our lives. They address various issues faced by early Christians, such as unity, spiritual growth, and ethical behaviour. Paul\u0026rsquo;s letters, for example, offer guidance on how to live a Christ-centred life, emphasizing the importance of love, humility, and perseverance. The Epistles remind us that our faith is not just a set of beliefs but a way of life that impacts every aspect of our existence. Revelation: The book of Revelation assures us that the darkness will pass, and Jesus Christ will be fully manifested in the universe. It provides a vision of the ultimate victory of good over evil and the establishment of God\u0026rsquo;s eternal kingdom. This prophetic book encourages us to remain faithful and hopeful, knowing that God\u0026rsquo;s plan will ultimately prevail. It reminds us that our struggles are temporary and that we have a glorious future awaiting us in God\u0026rsquo;s presence. The Bible equips us for every good work, as stated in 2 Timothy 3:16-17: \u0026ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\u0026rdquo;\nSo What?\nSo, what does this mean for us? It means that the Bible is not just an ancient book; it\u0026rsquo;s a living guide, a map leading to the greatest treasure of all – a deep and fulfilling relationship with God. When we read and study it, we invite God to transform us, guide us, and fulfill His purpose in our lives.\nJust like the young explorer who finds his way with the help of a mentor, we too can discover the treasures of life with God\u0026rsquo;s guidance through the Bible. Let\u0026rsquo;s embark on this journey together, trusting that God will lead us to the fullness of life He has promised.\nThe Choice\nBut God will not force Himself on us. He knocks (Revelation 3:20). He calls (John 10:27). He waits.\nWill we turn toward Him? Will we, like the boy who chases the girl he loves, run after God with all our hearts? Will we, like the prodigal son, finally run home? (Luke 15:20)\n\u0026ldquo;You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.\u0026rdquo; (Jeremiah 29:13). \u0026ldquo;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.\u0026rdquo; (James 4:8)\nConclusion\nThe Bible is God\u0026rsquo;s revelation, a treasure map that leads us to a deeper, more fulfilling relationship with Him. It reveals our inadequacies without God, revealing the emptiness we face without His presence and showing us the way to true fulfillment through Jesus Christ. Yet, we must choose to receive it. By embracing the Bible and allowing it to guide us, we can experience the fullness of life God intended. So, let\u0026rsquo;s commit to spending time in the Bible, seeking His guidance, and allowing Him to transform us into the people He created us to be. As we journey through life, may we hold fast to the truths of God\u0026rsquo;s Word, allowing it to shape our hearts, minds, and actions. And in doing so, may we become the men and women God has called us to be, reflecting His love, grace, and truth to the world around us.\nThis is the Bible’s story: a God who loves, a people who must choose to love Him back, and the eternal joy that comes when we do.\nWhat will your answer be?\nResources # For more references, please see the following:\nRay Stedman on the whole Bible Bible Project animated videos on the Bible David Pawson on Studying the Bible Overview of the Bible Introducing the Bible by Canadian Bible Society Charles Price on Conviction about Scripture ","date":"13 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/overview-of-the-whole-bible---a-divine-library-with-one-grand-story/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Overview of the Whole Bible - A Divine Library with One Grand Story","type":"blog"},{"content":"(Adapted from Ray Stedman’s sermons on raystedman.org)\nIntroduction: A Story of Discovery # Imagine a young explorer, eager to uncover the secrets of an ancient civilization.

But there\u0026rsquo;s a catch – the map is complex, filled with symbols and paths that seem impossible to decipher without guidance. Realizing this, the explorer understands he needs a mentor to interpret the map and help him navigate the journey.\nIn many ways, we are like that young explorer, and the Bible is our map. It promises to lead us to the greatest treasure of all – a deep, fulfilling relationship with God. But to truly understand it, we need guidance and a willingness to embark on the journey.\nThe Inadequacy of Man Without God # The Bible, with its 66 books written over fifteen centuries by more than forty authors, presents a coherent theme: the story of man and his relationship with God. It reveals a profound truth – without God, we are incomplete. This inadequacy is evident in three realms:\nNatural Relationships: Our understanding of the physical world – cosmology, geology, biology – is limited without acknowledging the Creator. Think about the vastness of the universe, the intricate details of our planet, and the complexity of life itself. Without God, these wonders remain mysteries, and our understanding is superficial. Human Relationships: Our interactions with others – sociology, psychology, psychiatry – fall short without the love and guidance of God. Consider the conflicts, misunderstandings, and broken relationships that plague our world. Without God\u0026rsquo;s love and wisdom, we struggle to find true harmony and peace with one another. Spiritual Relationships: Our connection with God – theology, soteriology, philosophy – is essential for true fulfillment. Without God, we are like a ship without a compass, drifting aimlessly through life, searching for meaning and purpose. Without God, we struggle to understand the world, ourselves, and our purpose. We are like that young explorer, lost without a mentor to guide us. The Adequacy of Man with God # But the Bible doesn\u0026rsquo;t just highlight our inadequacies; it also reveals the solution. Jesus Christ, the perfect man, shows us what humanity was meant to be. With God, we can achieve:\nSovereignty over Nature: - Just as Jesus walked on water and calmed storms, we too can experience a harmonious relationship with the natural world. Imagine the peace and confidence that comes from knowing that the Creator of the universe is with us, guiding us through the challenges of life. Peace in Human Relationships: Like Abraham, who lived in peace with his former enemies, we can find harmony with others through God\u0026rsquo;s guidance. Picture a world where love, forgiveness, and understanding prevail, where even our enemies become our friends. Supreme Happiness in Spiritual Relationships: By embracing a relationship with God, we discover the righteousness, peace, and joy that we crave. Envision a life filled with purpose, contentment, and a deep sense of belonging, knowing that we are loved and valued by our Creator. Jesus Christ is the focus of the Bible, the perfect example of a life lived in complete dependence on God. He is our mentor, guiding us through the complexities of life. The Purpose of the Bible # So, why did God give us the Bible? What is its ultimate purpose? The Bible itself provides the answer. In Ephesians, Paul explains that God plans to bring unity and maturity in faith, leading us to Christlikeness. The Bible equips us for every good work, helping us grow into the people God created us to be.\nConsider these passages from Ephesians:\nEphesians 1:9-12: \u0026ldquo;With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ. In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.\u0026rdquo; Ephesians 3:10-12: \u0026ldquo;His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In him and through faith in him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence.\u0026rdquo; Ephesians 4:11-13: \u0026ldquo;So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.\u0026rdquo; These passages highlight God\u0026rsquo;s purpose to bring us to maturity and unity in Christ. The Bible is our guide, helping us grow in faith and understanding, equipping us for the journey ahead. The Gospel – The Good News of the Bible # The gospel is not just about forgiveness; it\u0026rsquo;s about living a fulfilled life through Christ. Major Ian Thomas, the founder of the Torchbearers Bible schools, beautifully summarizes this: \u0026ldquo;We must have what he is to be what he was.\u0026rdquo; By allowing Christ to live through us, we can experience the fullness of life that God intended.\nThink about it – Jesus lived a perfect life, demonstrating love, compassion, and righteousness in every situation. He faced the same challenges and temptations that we do, yet he remained sinless. By inviting Christ into our lives, we can draw on his strength and wisdom, enabling us to live as he did.\nThe gospel, or \u0026ldquo;good news,\u0026rdquo; is the heart of the Bible\u0026rsquo;s message. It tells us that God loves us so much that He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to live among us, to die for our sins, and to rise again, conquering death and offering us eternal life. This is the ultimate expression of God\u0026rsquo;s love and grace.\nThe Good News of Forgiveness # First and foremost, the gospel is about forgiveness. We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). Our sins separate us from God, creating a barrier that we cannot overcome on our own. But God, in His infinite love and mercy, provided a way for us to be reconciled to Him. Through the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross, our sins are forgiven, and we are made right with God.\nImagine carrying a heavy burden, a weight that you cannot lift on your own. The gospel tells us that Jesus has taken that burden upon Himself, freeing us from the weight of our sins. This forgiveness is not something we can earn; it is a gift of grace, freely given to all who believe in Jesus Christ.\nThe Good News of Transformation # But the gospel doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop at forgiveness. It also promises transformation. When we accept Jesus as our Savior, we are not only forgiven but also made new. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, \u0026ldquo;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!\u0026rdquo; This means our old, sinful nature is replaced with a new, Christlike nature.\nThis transformation is a lifelong process, known as sanctification. As we grow in our relationship with Christ, we become more like Him. The Holy Spirit works in us, changing our hearts and minds, helping us to live in a way that honours God. This transformation is evident in our actions, our attitudes, and our relationships with others.\nThe Good News of Purpose # The gospel also gives us a sense of purpose. Before we knew Christ, we may have felt lost, wandering through life without direction. But in Christ, we find our true purpose. Ephesians 2:10 tells us, \u0026ldquo;For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\u0026rdquo;\nGod has a plan for each of our lives, a unique purpose that only we can fulfill. As we walk with Him, He reveals His plan to us, guiding us and equipping us to do the good works He has prepared for us. This purpose gives our lives meaning and direction, filling us with a sense of fulfillment and joy.\nThe Good News of Eternal Life # Finally, the gospel promises eternal life. Jesus said in John 11:25-26, \u0026ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.\u0026rdquo; This means that death is not the end for those who believe in Christ. We have the hope of eternal life with God, a life free from pain, suffering, and sin.\nThis promise of eternal life gives us hope and comfort, especially in times of trial and loss. It reminds us that our time on earth is temporary and that we have a glorious future awaiting us in heaven. This hope sustains us, giving us the strength to persevere through life\u0026rsquo;s challenges.\nThe Importance of the Bible # To truly understand and live out the good news of the gospel, we need the Bible. It provides guidance through the stories of faith, the Law, the Prophets, the Gospels, the Epistles, and Revelation. It reveals God\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and ways, helping us navigate the complexities of life.\nConsider the following:\nThe Stories of Faith: The lives of David, Ruth, Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Mary, Paul, Peter, and others show us how God works in specific situations. Their stories encourage us and provide practical examples of faith in action. For instance, David\u0026rsquo;s courage in facing Goliath teaches us about trusting God in the face of overwhelming odds. Ruth\u0026rsquo;s loyalty and faithfulness demonstrate the power of love and commitment. Abraham\u0026rsquo;s journey of faith shows us the importance of obedience and trust in God\u0026rsquo;s promises. The Law: The Law helps us understand what God expects of us and reveals our need for a Saviour. It shows us our guilt and helplessness, pointing us to Christ. The Ten Commandments, for example, provide a moral framework that guides our behaviour and relationships. They remind us of our need for God\u0026rsquo;s grace and forgiveness, as we inevitably fall short of His standards. The Prophets: The Prophets provide a broader picture of God\u0026rsquo;s plan, offering hope and assurance that God is working all things out for our good. They call us to repentance and remind us of God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness and justice. The prophecies of Isaiah, for example, foretell the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom. These messages of hope and restoration encourage us to trust in God\u0026rsquo;s promises, even in difficult times. The Gospels: The Gospels reveal the perfect life of Jesus Christ, showing us what it means to live in complete dependence on God. They provide a detailed account of Jesus\u0026rsquo; teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection. Through the Gospels, we learn about Jesus\u0026rsquo; compassion for the marginalized, His commitment to truth and justice, and His sacrificial love for humanity. These accounts inspire us to follow His example and live out our faith in practical ways. The Epistles: The Epistles translate the truths of the Gospels into practical daily situations, helping us apply God\u0026rsquo;s Word to our lives. They address various issues faced by early Christians, such as unity, spiritual growth, and ethical behaviour. Paul\u0026rsquo;s letters, for example, offer guidance on how to live a Christ-centred life, emphasizing the importance of love, humility, and perseverance. The Epistles remind us that our faith is not just a set of beliefs but a way of life that impacts every aspect of our existence. Revelation: The book of Revelation assures us that the darkness will pass, and Jesus Christ will be fully manifested in the universe. It provides a vision of the ultimate victory of good over evil and the establishment of God\u0026rsquo;s eternal kingdom. This prophetic book encourages us to remain faithful and hopeful, knowing that God\u0026rsquo;s plan will ultimately prevail. It reminds us that our struggles are temporary and that we have a glorious future awaiting us in God\u0026rsquo;s presence. The Bible equips us for every good work, as stated in 2 Timothy 3:16-17: \u0026ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\u0026rdquo;\nSo What? # So, what does this mean for us? It means that the Bible is not just an ancient book; it\u0026rsquo;s a living guide, a map leading to the greatest treasure of all – a deep and fulfilling relationship with God. When we read and study it, we invite God to transform us, guide us, and fulfill His purpose in our lives.\nJust like the young explorer who finds his way with the help of a mentor, we too can discover the treasures of life with God\u0026rsquo;s guidance through the Bible. Let\u0026rsquo;s embark on this journey together, trusting that God will lead us to the fullness of life He has promised.\nThe Choice # But God will not force Himself on us. He knocks (Revelation 3:20). He calls (John 10:27). He waits.\nWill we turn toward Him? Will we, like the boy who chases the girl he loves, run after God with all our hearts? Will we, like the prodigal son, finally run home? (Luke 15:20)\n\u0026ldquo;You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.\u0026rdquo; (Jeremiah 29:13). \u0026ldquo;Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.\u0026rdquo; (James 4:8)\nConclusion # The Bible is God\u0026rsquo;s revelation, a treasure map that leads us to a deeper, more fulfilling relationship with Him. It reveals our inadequacies without God, revealing the emptiness we face without His presence and showing us the way to true fulfillment through Jesus Christ. Yet, we must choose to receive it. By embracing the Bible and allowing it to guide us, we can experience the fullness of life God intended. So, let\u0026rsquo;s commit to spending time in the Bible, seeking His guidance, and allowing Him to transform us into the people He created us to be. As we journey through life, may we hold fast to the truths of God\u0026rsquo;s Word, allowing it to shape our hearts, minds, and actions. And in doing so, may we become the men and women God has called us to be, reflecting His love, grace, and truth to the world around us. This is the Bible’s story: a God who loves, a people who must choose to love Him back, and the eternal joy that comes when we do.\nWhat will your answer be?\nResources # For more references, please see the following:\nRay Stedman on the whole Bible Bible Project animated videos on the Bible David Pawson on Studying the Bible Overview of the Bible Introducing the Bible by Canadian Bible Society Charles Price on Conviction about Scripture ","date":"12 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/the-bible-gods-revelation/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"The Bible: God’s Revelation","type":"blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
