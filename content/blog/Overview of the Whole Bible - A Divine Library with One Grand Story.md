**The Bible: A Divine Library with One Grand Story**

**_Adapted from Ray Stedman’s sermons on raystedman.org_**

The Bible is not just one book—it is a divine library of sixty-six books, written over centuries by various authors, yet telling one unified story of God's love, redemption, and purpose for humanity. This article is the first in a series that will explore each book of the Bible, one by one. But before we dive into individual overviews, we begin here with the big picture: an overview of the Bible as a whole. This foundational piece sets the stage for understanding how each book fits into the grand narrative of Scripture and how the entire Bible reveals God's heart and plan for the world.

**Introduction: A Story of Discovery**

Imagine a young explorer, eager to uncover the secrets of an ancient civilization. He stumbles upon a dusty, old map hidden in a forgotten library. This map promises to lead him to a treasure beyond his wildest dreams. But there's a catch – the map is complex, filled with symbols and paths that seem impossible to decipher without guidance. Realizing this, the explorer understands he needs a mentor to interpret the map and help him navigate the journey.

In many ways, we are like that young explorer, and the Bible is our map. It promises to lead us to the greatest treasure of all – a deep, fulfilling relationship with God. But to truly understand it, we need guidance and a willingness to embark on the journey.

**The Inadequacy of Man without God**

The Bible, with its 66 books written over fifteen centuries by more than forty authors, presents a coherent theme: the story of man and his relationship with God. It reveals a profound truth – without God, we are incomplete. This inadequacy is evident in three realms:

1. **Natural Relationships**: Our understanding of the physical world – cosmology, geology, biology – is limited without acknowledging the Creator. Think about the vastness of the universe, the intricate details of our planet, and the complexity of life itself. Without God, these wonders remain mysteries, and our understanding is superficial.
2. **Human Relationships**: Our interactions with others – sociology, psychology, psychiatry – fall short without the love and guidance of God. Consider the conflicts, misunderstandings, and broken relationships that plague our world. Without God's love and wisdom, we struggle to find true harmony and peace with one another.
3. **Spiritual Relationships**: Our connection with God – theology, soteriology, philosophy – is essential for true fulfillment. Without God, we are like a ship without a compass, drifting aimlessly through life, searching for meaning and purpose.

Without God, we struggle to understand the world, ourselves, and our purpose. We are like that young explorer, lost without a mentor to guide us.

**The Adequacy of Man with God**

The Bible does not merely expose our inadequacy, it presents the remedy: Christ Himself. Through Him, we are restored to what God intended us to be. Christ didn’t just come to model righteousness, He came to make righteousness possible for us. He is the very presence of God, stepping into human history to restore what was broken. Imagine a king wanting to rescue his people. He could send messengers, but instead, He steps down from His throne, becomes one of them, and leads them home Himself. His incarnation wasn’t just about showing us how to live; it was about making a way for us to be reunited with the Father. Through His sacrifice, He bridged the gap between humanity and God, offering us a new life. “Christ in us, and us in Christ” speaks to the deep spiritual transformation and identity we receive through Him. Through Christ, we are forgiven and made new. His Spirit fills us, guiding and transforming us.

With **Christ in us**—His life transforming ours—and **us in Christ**—abiding in His presence and identity—we can experience fullness in every realm of life:

1. **Sovereignty over Nature:** Christ demonstrated mastery over creation, not only walking on water and calming storms, but also feeding multitudes and restoring the broken. When we are in Him and He in us, our perspective on nature shifts; we move from exploiting creation to stewarding it as God intended, embracing responsibility and harmony with His world.
2. **Peace in Human Relationships:** Without Christ, human relationships are fractured, marked by selfishness and conflict. But in Christ, we are made new, empowered to love, forgive, and extend grace as He did. Just as Jesus healed relationships, whether restoring Peter after his denial or reconciling enemies through the cross, we, in Him, can experience deep reconciliation, breaking cycles of division and strife.
3. **Supreme Happiness in Spiritual Relationships:** Christ Himself declared, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). Without Him, we are lost in confusion and longing. But when He dwells in us, and we abide in Him, our souls find purpose, peace, and joy—not fleeting happiness, but true fulfillment in communion with God.

This is our calling—to be transformed by Him, dwelling in Him, and allowing Him to reshape every aspect of our lives. Christ is more than an example; He is our life (Galatians 2:20), the One through whom we become all that God intended. He is our mentor, guiding us through the complexities of life.

**The Purpose of the Bible**

So, why did God give us the Bible? What is its ultimate purpose? The Bible itself provides the answer. In Ephesians, Paul explains that God plans to bring unity and maturity in faith, leading us to Christlikeness. The Bible equips us for every good work, helping us grow into the people God created us to be.

Consider these passages from Ephesians:

- **Ephesians 1:9-12**: "With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ. In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory."
- **Ephesians 3:10-12**: "His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In him and through faith in him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence."
- **Ephesians 4:11-13**: "So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

These passages highlight God's purpose to bring us to **unity and maturity in faith**, leading us to **Christlikeness**. The Bible is our guide, helping us grow in faith and understanding, equipping us for the journey ahead.

**The Gospel – The Good News of the Bible**

The gospel is not just about forgiveness; it's about living a fulfilled life through Christ. Major Ian Thomas, the founder of the Torchbearers Bible schools, beautifully summarizes this: "We must have what he is to be what he was." By allowing Christ to live through us, we can experience the fullness of life that God intended.

Think about it – Jesus lived a perfect life, demonstrating love, compassion, and righteousness in every situation. He faced the same challenges and temptations that we do, yet he remained sinless. By allowing **Christ to live through us, we experience the fullness of life** that God intended.

The gospel, or "good news," is the heart of the Bible's message. It tells us that God loves us so much that He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to live among us, to die for our sins, and to rise again, conquering death and offering us eternal life. This is the ultimate expression of God's love and grace.

**The Good News of Forgiveness**

First and foremost, the gospel is about forgiveness. We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). Our sins separate us from God, creating a barrier that we cannot overcome on our own. But God, in His infinite love and mercy, provided a way for us to be reconciled to Him. Through the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross, our sins are forgiven, and we are made right with God.

Imagine carrying a heavy burden, a weight that you cannot lift on your own. The gospel tells us that Jesus has taken that burden upon Himself, freeing us from the weight of our sins. This forgiveness is not something we can earn; it is a gift of grace, freely given to all who believe in Jesus Christ.

**The Good News of Transformation**

But the gospel doesn't stop at forgiveness. It also promises transformation. When we accept Jesus as our Savior, we are not only forgiven but also made new. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" This means our old, sinful nature is replaced with a new, Christlike nature.

This transformation is a lifelong process, known as sanctification. As we grow in our relationship with Christ, we become more like Him. The Holy Spirit works in us, changing our hearts and minds, helping us to live in a way that honours God. This transformation is evident in our actions, our attitudes, and our relationships with others.

**The Good News of Purpose**

The gospel also gives us a sense of purpose. Before we knew Christ, we may have felt lost, wandering through life without direction. But in Christ, we find our true purpose. Ephesians 2:10 tells us, "For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."

God has a plan for each of our lives, a unique purpose that only we can fulfill. As we walk with Him, He reveals His plan to us, guiding us and equipping us to do the good works He has prepared for us. This purpose gives our lives meaning and direction, filling us with a sense of fulfillment and joy.

**The Good News of Eternal Life**

Finally, the gospel promises eternal life. Jesus said in John 11:25-26, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die." This means that death is not the end for those who believe in Christ. We have the hope of eternal life with God, a life free from pain, suffering, and sin.

This promise of eternal life gives us hope and comfort, especially in times of trial and loss. It reminds us that our time on earth is temporary and that we have a glorious future awaiting us in heaven. This hope sustains us, giving us the strength to persevere through life's challenges.

**The Importance of the Bible**

To truly understand and live out the good news of the gospel, we need the Bible. It provides guidance through the stories of faith, the Law, the Prophets, the Gospels, the Epistles, and Revelation. It reveals God's thoughts and ways, helping us navigate the complexities of life.

Consider the following:

- **The Stories of Faith**: The lives of David, Ruth, Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Mary, Paul, Peter, and others show us how God works in specific situations. Their stories encourage us and provide practical examples of faith in action. For instance, David's courage in facing Goliath teaches us about trusting God in the face of overwhelming odds. Ruth's loyalty and faithfulness demonstrate the power of love and commitment. Abraham's journey of faith shows us the importance of obedience and trust in God's promises.
- **The Law**: The Law helps us understand what God expects of us and reveals our need for a Saviour. It shows us our guilt and helplessness, pointing us to Christ. The Ten Commandments, for example, provide a moral framework that guides our behaviour and relationships. They remind us of our need for God's grace and forgiveness, as we inevitably fall short of His standards.
- **The Prophets**: The Prophets provide a broader picture of God's plan, offering hope and assurance that God is working all things out for our good. They call us to repentance and remind us of God's faithfulness and justice. The prophecies of Isaiah, for example, foretell the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God's kingdom. These messages of hope and restoration encourage us to trust in God's promises, even in difficult times.
- **The Gospels**: The Gospels reveal the perfect life of Jesus Christ, showing us what it means to live in complete dependence on God. They provide a detailed account of Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection. Through the Gospels, we learn about Jesus' compassion for the marginalized, His commitment to truth and justice, and His sacrificial love for humanity. These accounts inspire us to follow His example and live out our faith in practical ways.
- **The Epistles**: The Epistles translate the truths of the Gospels into practical daily situations, helping us apply God's Word to our lives. They address various issues faced by early Christians, such as unity, spiritual growth, and ethical behaviour. Paul's letters, for example, offer guidance on how to live a Christ-centred life, emphasizing the importance of love, humility, and perseverance. The Epistles remind us that our faith is not just a set of beliefs but a way of life that impacts every aspect of our existence.
- **Revelation**: The book of Revelation assures us that the darkness will pass, and Jesus Christ will be fully manifested in the universe. It provides a vision of the ultimate victory of good over evil and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. This prophetic book encourages us to remain faithful and hopeful, knowing that God's plan will ultimately prevail. It reminds us that our struggles are temporary and that we have a glorious future awaiting us in God's presence.

The Bible equips us for every good work, as stated in 2 Timothy 3:16-17: "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."

**So What?**

So, what does this mean for us? It means that the Bible is not just an ancient book; it's a living guide, a map leading to the greatest treasure of all – a deep and fulfilling relationship with God. When we read and study it, we invite God to transform us, guide us, and fulfill His purpose in our lives.

Just like the young explorer who finds his way with the help of a mentor, we too can discover the treasures of life with God's guidance through the Bible. Let's embark on this journey together, trusting that God will lead us to the fullness of life He has promised.

**The Choice**

But God will not force Himself on us. He knocks (Revelation 3:20). He calls (John 10:27). He waits.

Will we turn toward Him? Will we, like the boy who chases the girl he loves, run after God with all our hearts? Will we, like the prodigal son, finally run home? (Luke 15:20)

"You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart." (Jeremiah 29:13). "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you." (James 4:8)

**Conclusion**

The Bible is God's revelation, a treasure map that leads us to a deeper, more fulfilling relationship with Him. It reveals our inadequacies without God, revealing the emptiness we face without His presence and showing us the way to true fulfillment through Jesus Christ. Yet, we must choose to receive it. By embracing the Bible and allowing it to guide us, we can experience the fullness of life God intended. So, let's commit to spending time in the Bible, seeking His guidance, and allowing Him to transform us into the people He created us to be. As we journey through life, may we hold fast to the truths of God's Word, allowing it to shape our hearts, minds, and actions. And in doing so, may we become the men and women God has called us to be, reflecting His love, grace, and truth to the world around us.

This is the Bible’s story: a God who loves, a people who must choose to love Him back, and the eternal joy that comes when we do.
