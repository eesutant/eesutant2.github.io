**The Divine Purpose of the Old Testament: Preparation for Christ**

(Adapted from Ray Stedman’s sermons on raystedman.org)

**Introduction: The Unity of the Bible**

The Bible is God’s complete revelation to humanity, comprised of the Old and New Testaments. Last time, we explored the purpose of God’s revelation in the Bible, to mature us as believers into the complete expression of Jesus Christ. The entire Bible is necessary for this transformation, with the Holy Spirit helping us understand it.

While the New Testament reveals the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan in Jesus Christ, the Old Testament serves as the essential foundation, a divine preparation that creates the framework for understanding Christ’s coming. Through prophecies, sacrifices, and deep spiritual longings, the Old Testament follows a progressive pattern, with the Old Testament containing "the shadow of the good things to come" (Hebrews 10:1) that find their substance in Christ and points forward to the Messiah, building anticipation and revealing humanity’s need for salvation.

**The Road to Emmaus: A Story of Burning Hearts**

In Luke 24, two disciples were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus’ resurrection. They were heartbroken and confused after His crucifixion. While they walked and talked, Jesus Himself approached them, unrecognized, and asked what they were discussing.

They explained the tragic events, how Jesus of Nazareth, whom they had hoped was the Messiah, had been crucified. They mentioned strange rumours that His tomb was empty, but they didn’t know what to believe.

Jesus responded, “O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!” Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He showed them how the Scriptures pointed to Him.

Later, they recalled: “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?”

This is the heart of the Old Testament’s role: to stir anticipation, awaken faith, and prepare us to meet Christ.

**The Old Testament: Unfinished by Design**

Dr. W. H. Griffith Thomas once suggested that if we read the Old Testament without knowing the New, we’d notice:

**1\. Unfulfilled Prophecy**

From Genesis onward, prophecies unfold pointing toward a promised figure. These grow richer in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Malachi, yet the identity of the One foretold remains unrevealed.

**2\. Unexplained Sacrifices**

A stream of blood flows through the Old Testament, from Abel’s offering to the temple sacrifices. Yet the meaning behind this repeated shedding of blood remains unresolved.

**3\. Unsatisfied Longings**

From Abraham searching for a city “whose builder and maker is God” to the cries in Psalms and Ecclesiastes, we see human hearts yearning for something beyond the present world.

By the end of Malachi, the reader is left with tension and expectation, a story unfinished.

Then comes the New Testament:

“The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ...”

He is the One who fulfills the prophecy, explains the sacrifice, and satisfies the longing.

**The Old Testament’s Threefold Cry**

Dr. G. Campbell Morgan described the Old Testament in three major cries:

• **A sigh for a priest** - The Law reveals man’s need for a mediator.

• **A cry for a king** - The Historical books reveal the longing for righteous leadership.

• **A quest for a prophet** - The Wisdom and Prophetic books seek a voice to interpret life and unveil the future.

Each of these cries finds its answer in Jesus Christ, our perfect Priest, King, and Prophet.

**Why the Old Testament is Essential for Understanding the New**

Hebrews 1:1–2 contrasts the Old and New Testaments: "In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son."

The Old Testament speaks with diverse voices:

• The majestic creation accounts of Genesis,

• The lives of the patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

• The thundering of the laws in Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy,

• The drama of the historical books,

• The poetic cries of the Psalms,

• The exalted visions of the Prophets,

• The wise sayings of Proverbs,

• The mysteries of Ezekiel and Daniel,

• The delicate tenderness of the Song of Solomon, Ruth, and Esther.

Yet, the Old Testament always speaks in phrases and glimpses. It points forward but never fully satisfies. In Christ, all the fragmented voices of the Old Testament merge into a single, glorious voice.

**Why the Old Testament Is Essential**

Some might think, "Why not skip the Old Testament and just start with Jesus?"  
But skipping preparation leads to shallow understanding.

Jesus Himself said that if people would not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they would not be convinced even by someone rising from the dead (Luke 16:31).

Similarly, just as a field must be plowed before planting, the human heart must be tilled by the Old Testament before the seed of Christ can fully take root.

The Old Testament reveals humanity’s failure, longing, and need, setting the stage for Christ’s complete answer.

**A True Story: The Power of Isaiah**

Dr. H. A. Ironside once met a young man in San Bernardino who, though skeptical of Christianity, was captivated by the eloquence of Isaiah. Reading Isaiah 53, which portrays a suffering figure bearing the sins of others, moved him deeply. When Ironside asked him who Isaiah 53 described, the young man realized it was about Jesus.

Later, the young man testified that he once cursed at Gordon’s Calvary in Jerusalem, furious at the "Christian myth." But after encountering Isaiah’s prophecy, he recognized that the one he had cursed was actually the One who died for his sins.

It was the Old Testament, not argument or philosophy, that prepared his heart.

**Final Thoughts**

The Old Testament is an **experience book**. It expresses humanity’s struggles with injustice, pain, and longing. The Psalms especially give voice to every human emotion. Without the Old Testament, the New Testament’s message would seem abrupt and disconnected.

The Old Testament gives Christmas its anticipation ("Unto us a child is born..."), Good Friday its meaning ("He was wounded for our transgressions..."), and Easter its triumph.

Ultimately, the Old Testament exists to awaken our need, to stir our longing, and to ready our hearts for the glorious arrival of Christ, the fulfillment of all prophecy, sacrifice, and hope.

**Conclusion: From Shadows to Substance**

The Old Testament is not a collection of outdated stories; it is God’s deliberate preparation for the New. Like scattered puzzle pieces forming a complete picture, its prophecies, sacrifices, and longings find their fulfillment in Jesus. The Old Testament sets our hearts aflame with divine anticipation, ensuring that when we meet Christ in the Gospels, we recognize Him as the answer to all of God’s promises. To neglect the Old Testament is to miss the depth of God’s redemptive plan—one that begins in Genesis and culminates in Revelation.
